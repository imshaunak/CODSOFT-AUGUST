    "Creating a To-Do List application in Python is a great project idea! You have the flexibility to choose between a command-line interface (CLI) or a graphical user interface (GUI) based on your preferences and the complexity you want to implement. I'll outline the steps to create both versions so you can choose the one that suits you best.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define the Core To-Do List Functionality:\n",
    "Regardless of the interface type, you'll need to define the core functionality of your To-Do List application. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding tasks to the list\n",
    "Viewing the current tasks in the list\n",
    "Marking tasks as completed\n",
    "Deleting tasks from the list\n",
    "Saving and loading the tasks from a file\n",
    "Command-Line Interface (CLI) Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Use argparse or sys.argv:\n",
    "For the CLI version, you can use argparse or sys.argv to parse command-line arguments and allow users to interact with the application via the terminal.\n",

    "b. Implement the Commands:\n",
    "Define commands like add, view, complete, delete, etc., which users can enter in the terminal to perform specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Store Tasks in a File:\n",
    "Store the tasks in a text file or a simple database to persist the data between different runs of the application.\n",

    "Graphical User Interface (GUI) Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Choose a GUI Framework:\n",
    "You can use popular Python GUI frameworks such as Tkinter, PyQt, or Kivy. Tkinter is a standard choice that comes bundled with Python, making it an easy option for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Design the Interface:\n",
    "Design a simple and user-friendly interface that allows users to interact with the To-Do List. Create buttons, input fields, and other UI elements for adding, viewing, updating, and deleting tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Implement Functionality:\n",
    "Attach the appropriate functions to the GUI elements to handle the user's actions, such as clicking buttons to add or delete tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Store Tasks:\n",
    "For the GUI version, you can still store tasks in a file as you did in the CLI version or use a database if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Common To-Do List Functions:\n",
    "Write functions that are used by both the CLI and GUI versions to maintain the To-Do List data, such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, deleting tasks, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add Error Handling:\n",
    "Ensure that your application gracefully handles potential errors, like incorrect user input or file-related issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing and Debugging:\n",
    "Test your application thoroughly, identifying and fixing any potential bugs or issues."
